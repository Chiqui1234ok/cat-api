# laravel-jenkins-test

## Build from source:

```bash
cd .docker
make build
```

## Set-up

You should place "laravel" folder with laravel app in it, and "mysql" with an installation of mysql (and a database, of course).
If you don't have a mysql database placed, docker will create one for you.

### Environment variables

Inside *.docker* folder, create .env file with this content:

```bash
MYSQL_DATABASE=laravel
MYSQL_USER=writeUsernameHere
MYSQL_PASSWORD=writePasswordHere
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=writePasswordForRootHere
```

## If none laravel install is present, install it:

1. Enter into the container with:

```bash
docker compose exec laravel bash
```

2. Install Laravel with composer (*--prefer-dist* will download Laravel as one compressed file. It's faster)

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel .
```

3. Enter into .docker folder and do:

```bash
make up
```

Docker container will start with all their 4 services (nginx, laravel, mysql, phpmyadmin)

## Address permission issues

I had permission issues and fresh-installed Laravel can't continue because can't write inside *laravel* folder. Also, I can't read or write inside that folder because the user who's editing code in my VSCode is santiago, and the user of the folder is www-data, indeed. I solved with these two commands:

In parent folder (where *.docker* it's placed, and probably *laravel* and *mysql* too) do this as **sudo**:

```bash
chmod 777 -R laravel
chmod 777 -R mysql
chown -R www-data:www-data laravel # just to be sure
```
